templateEngine
==============

java template enginge for web projects.

It's main focus is to keep the templates (html) and the source code (java) stricted separate. 

Key features:
* ___Auto-Documentation___: java programmer throws a variable into the engine and the HTML coder does have a documentation (dictionary) for all existing variables
* ___Internal Server-Side Template-Interpreter___: an internal server-side interpreter included into the template engine enables even simple java codes to be placed into the templates (so the java programmer don't have to deal with formating issues for single variables!)
* ___HTML Coder don't need access___: templates could be located outside (ftp or svn), so the programmer don't have to give the html coder full access to the sourcecode
* ___HTML Attribute Keywords___: so the HTML-Coder don't have to have XML or Java or any special knowledge but HTML
